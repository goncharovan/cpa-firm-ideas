# Task List: Email/Password Login Functionality

## Relevant Files

- `src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Main signin page component that needs to be converted to client component and fixed
- `src/app/auth/signin/page.test.tsx` - Unit tests for the signin page component
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - NextAuth configuration (no changes needed, but referenced for understanding)
- `src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts` - Signup API route (no changes needed, but referenced for comparison)

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npm test` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- The signup page (`src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx`) serves as a reference for the correct implementation pattern.
